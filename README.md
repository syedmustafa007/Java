# Java Programming

## Programming Concepts
- Syntax: In programming, syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure and formation of a programming language.

- Keywords or Reserve words: In programming, keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings. They are essential parts of a programming language's syntax, controlling program structure and logic. The compiler recognizes keywords and uses for specific purposes. Example: `public`, `class`, `if`, `else` etc.

- Compiler: A compiler is a computer program that translates code written in a **high-level programming language** (like C++, Java, or Python) into a **low-level language** (machine code, bytecode or assemlbly), that a computer can directly understand and execute. It essentially acts as a `translator`, converting human-readable code into a format that the computer's processor can process. **Note**: The Java compiler is `javac`.

## Java Concepts
- Comment:
- Class:
- Method:
- Data types: 

## Steps to write a java program
- Create a `public` class. The name of the class is the same as the file name.
- Create a `public static void main(String [] args)` method.
- Use `System.out.println` to print output.
- Compile with `javac HelloWorld.java`.
- Run with `java HelloWorld`.

## Importence of Java
-Java  is a versatile and widely used programming language that's important because it allows developers to create applications that can run on many different types of devices (like computers, phones, and smart TVs) and in different environments (like web servers and cloud systems). Without Java there would have mostly been no websites or apps.
